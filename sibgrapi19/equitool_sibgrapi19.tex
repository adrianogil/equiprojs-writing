 Virtual Reality (VR) applications provide immersive experience when using panoramic images; that contain 360\degree view of the scene. Equirectangular image is the widely used format to represent panoramic images. However, in order to develop a 360\degree view in equirectangular image format, various parameters influence the quality of the captured image. These parameters include resolution configurations, texture-to-objects mappings and choosing among different media formats. To select the optimal value of these parameters, a viusal quality analysis is required. In this work, we propose a tool integrated with Unity editor to automate the quality assessment of different settings of 360\degree image visualization. We compare the texture mapping of a Skybox rendering with a procedural sphere and a Cubemap using the objective metrics for Image Quality Analysis (IQA). Based on the assessment, the tool decides how the final image will be rendered at the target device to produce high quality and visually pleasing image.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
 Images captured in 360\degree surroundings of a single point are capable of simulating the entire visual information available from that point. Also, specific cameras are designed to capture such images, such as Samsung Gear 360\degree that capture panoramic images and store these images in a suitable format for 360\degree visualizations. These images are stored in a specific format to facilitate image processing. The equirectangular image format is the one widely adopted. Furthermore, equirectangular images can be used in Virtual reality applications to provide an immersive user experience and allows user to experience being inside the scene. \par
Virtual Reality (VR) devices render the virtual world with a different image for each eye in order to emulate depth and as a result, increase the sense of presence within the context of the application. Although the technology behind the VR headset display has evolved, it still faces the challenge of offering a high density of pixels per Field of View (FoV) degree. Furthermore, the human eye has an estimated resolution of 60 pixels per degree, which means that an average 100-degrees device should render its content at the 6k resolution to provide a realistic spatial emulation~\cite{va1965visual}. \par
A 360\degree image viewer usually renders its contents in a sphere to mimic the natural placement of visual elements as they would be perceived by the user in the real world. A large number of pixels are required to keep the quality of the pictures. The research for the best possible visual quality means picking an exhibition format in a given set of different exhibition formats, each one with different distortion degrees along the existing 360 degrees. In order to decide the appropriate format and resolution for a 360\degree image, it is necessary to take into consideration the device in which this picture will be displayed. Therefore, an image quality assessment tool is necessary that can simulate devices and compare image settings for quality so that it may provide the most suitable image choice. \par
There are two approaches for image quality assessment: subjective and objective metrics. Subjective Image Quality Analysis (IQA) employs human observers to evaluate and score a sequence of pictures, and objective IQA build mathematical models for automatic image quality assessment. Subjective IQA is accurate, however it is expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, objective IQA may provide a cost effective solution for image analysis and can be embedded in VR application. To build VR applications, various tools have been proposed such as Unity Editor, Source, Panda3D to name a few.  \par

Unity Editor is a game development engine for computers, mobile, console, virtual, and augmented reality. It is both used by small development groups as well as big corporations such as Microsoft and Disney; it is also the most used development tool for virtual reality. \textcolor{blue}{From its github account\footnote{https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/SkyboxPanoramicShader}, Unity provides built-in solutions for rendering panoramic images. The developer is also able to create its own solutions by customizing shaders, e.g, code that is meant to be executed at GPU and influences how 3D elements are shown on the device screen.}

In this paper, we propose an equirectangular image quality assessment tool which employs objective metrics integrated into the Unity Editor. To make assessments as close to real case scenarios, our tool is capable of simulating visualization with the field of view and resolution values provided by the user. Figure~\ref{fig:tool} below presents the Unity Editor interface we built. \textcolor{blue}{By configuring specific values to field of view, screenshot resolution, it's possible to simulate the viewport of a given device. For instance, a 101-degree field of view and 1440 x 1480 resolution it's close to the user view inside a VR application running in a Samsung S9.} The screenshots directions field let user insert three-dimensional vectors indicating the direction each screenshot should be pointing to. Finally report and graphs are generated according to the chosen metrics.

Rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:related_work} review the most relevant work in equirectangular images and IQA. Next, the proposed method is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:proposedMethod}. Furthermore, the preliminary experimental results are presented and discussed in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}. Finally, the most important conclusions and future work in the direction are given in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

VR applications differ from other vision applications due to their innate concern to provide content to all possible VR viewpoints. Furthermore, VR headsets can isolate the spectator both visually and acoustically from the real world~\cite{fuchs2017virtual}.
Spherical panoramic content may be presented in different projection types: equirectangular (ERP), rectilinear, doughnut, cube-map, and multiview~\cite{zakharchenko2016quality}. Moreover, the format of the 360\degree image plays a vital role in the resolution and uniformity of such images~\cite{dunn2017resolution}. For instance, equirectangular images have a high resolution on the poles and high uniformity on the equator line; On the other hand, cube-map images have a high density on the edges and high uniformity in each face of the diagonal~\cite{duanmu:2018}. For all these projection types, the quality of the images selected to create a panoramic view is crucial to present the panoramic content.  \par

Image Quality Analysis (IQA) assess the quality of the images to be used in the creation of panoramic view. IQA can be categorized into two types, i.e., subjective analysis and objective analysis~\cite{wang2006modern}. The most reliable strategy to evaluate image quality is through subjective analysis. In this case, human observers assess a set of pictures and score it in a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), this technique is called MOS (Mean Opinion Score) and it calculates the average score given a set of scores for each sample. Pinson et al. compared and analysed various methodologies for subjective video quality assessment~\cite{pinson:2003}. These test methods include single or double stimulus quality assessment methods. In single stimulus methods only one impaired video stream is used for assessment. However, in double stimulus a reference videos is also provided to the user for comparative analysis~\cite{pinson:2003}.  \par

Although subjective IQA  methods are precise, they are inconvenient and expensive. Especially when a VR environment is being evaluated because it is, by definition, more immersive, thus, a complementary objective metric would be useful and less expensive. Objective metrics are defined as Full-Reference (FR), No-Reference (NR), and Reduced-Reference (RR)~\cite{li:2019}. In FR-IQA methods, a non-distorted reference image is available to evaluate the test image. In RR-IQA methods, a reference image with only selective information is available to compare and measure the quality of the distorted image.
Whereas in NR-IQA methods, no reference image is available to compare, and the only available image is the one whose quality is measured.\par

Prior work on 360\degree IQA is discussed in Quality metric for spherical panoramic video~\cite{zakharchenko2016quality}. In this work, we focus on Full-reference IQA. Recent advancements in FR-IQA methods are comprehensively discussed FR stereo image quality assessment using natural stereo scene statistics~\cite{md2015full}.  We propose an FR quality assessment tool for the selection of images before using them to render on the target device. Despite our focus on image quality assessment of 360\degree spherical panoramic images, our proposal only assesses screenshots obtained from texture projections inside Unity3D. Therefore, our final target is 2D images as a result of such projections; which is intuitive because still 360\degree images or video sequences are encoded and transmitted in the 2D format under sphere-to-plane projection.

\section{Proposed Method}\label{sec:proposedMethod}

% General proposal
In this work, we propose a full-reference objective IQA tool to analyze viewport-based patches of panoramic images. Our implementation runs as a customs inspector script in Unity that mimics how the final image is going to be rendered at the target device. Different rendering implementations can be tested using the same equirectangular image. We also describe our implementation of converting an equirectangular image into a cubemap format.

% FR IQA metrics / Skybox
Our solution is a fully-automatic way to compare different rendering configurations of spherical images. After choosing an equirectangular image, a target resolution, a field of view in degrees, a set of viewing directions and a set of rendering solutions, different images patches are generated according to an approximated viewport inside the panoramic exhibition. Each image patch is evaluated according to objective metrics using a reference patch. In order to compare different rendering implementations, we chose Skybox rendering as the reference image, considering its widespread usage in the game and virtual reality applications.

% Conversion among different rendering approaches
The standard implementation of a spherical image viewer makes use of a sphere with inverted normals. Due to their characteristics, equirectangular images are distorted at poles, while cubemaps are distorted at their corners. That is why it is interesting to test an image in different formats. In this section, we describe a shader-based implementation to fit equirectangular images in a cubemap visual representation.

\subsection{Projecting 360\degree Images to UV Mapping} \label{sec:uvmapping}

Panoramic images comprehend the entire field-of-view of the user. Considering the
equirectangular format, some mapping implementations are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Utilize a sphere mesh to render the 360\degree image inside it;
    \item Utilize a Skybox to render the 360\degree image on the background;
    \item Map the 360\degree image to UV positions of a cubic mesh.
\end{enumerate}

Each mapping possibility has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of resolution offered by angular direction and general distortion of the 360\degree image.

\subsection{Mapping Equirectangular Images to a Sphere}

For mapping equirectangular images to sphere, We adopt the standard UV mapping technique for spheres which is based on the latitude/longitude approach. That means we need to find a three-dimension coordinate ($x$, $y$, $z$) for a set of $n x m$ UV coordinates ($u$,$v$).

Given $n$ longitude values, the angular size $T$ can be obtained by using:

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{2 \pi}{N}.
\label{longitudesize}
\end{equation}

Considering a sphere, an angular position $\alpha_{i}$ represents the ith longitude value:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{i} = i * T,
\label{longitudealpha}
\end{equation}

The sine and cosine of the angle T define the X and Z axes positions of the sphere points which belong to the cross section of the sphere. In such manner, assuming a sphere of radius R, the X and Z axes positions can be computed as:
\begin{equation}
x_{i} = R * \sin(\alpha_{i}),
\label{x_d}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
z_{i} = R * \cos(\alpha_{i}).
\label{z_d}
\end{equation}

In a longitudinal cut, the R-ray of a cross-section varies along the height of the sphere. For this reason, angular size $K$ considering a total of $M$ latitude values can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
K = \frac{\pi}{M}.
\label{equation5}
\end{equation}

The mth latitude value $\alpha_{ym}$ can be obtained by equation:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{ym} = m * K
\label{equation6}
\end{equation}

The $Y$ axis position $y_{m}$ for each sphere point can be obtained by considering unit radius using:

\begin{equation}
y_{m} = \cos(\alpha_{ym}),
\label{equation7}
\end{equation}

The radius $R_{ym}$ obtained in a cross section at latitude $m$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
R_{ym} = \sin(\alpha_{ym})
\label{equation8}
\end{equation}

Applying equation \ref{equation8} in equations \ref{x_d} and \ref{z_d} we get positions X and Z of the vertices of the sphere according to a longitude $n$ and latitude $m$ coordinates resulting in equations \ref{equation9} and \ref{equation10}.

\begin{equation}
x(m,n) = \sin(\alpha_{ym}) * \sin(\alpha_n),
\label{equation9}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
z(m,n) = \sin(\alpha_{ym}) * \cos(\alpha_n).
\label{equation10}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
y(m,n) = \cos(\alpha_{ym}),
\label{equation7}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mapping Equirectangular Images to a Skybox}

A skybox is rendered when no 3D element is rasterized by the virtual camera. In the rasterization process, it is necessary to identify a UV coordinate for each pixel (or fragment) rendered on screen. Skybox shaders usually utilize 3D textures to store the six faces of a cube through a graphical function called tex3D.

Mapping an equirectangular image to a skybox involves finding the UV vector value given a normalized direction. Considering the vector (x, y, z) as the normalized direction, equation \ref{eq:equation11} can be used on a vertex shader.

\begin{equation}
    uv = (\arctan{(\frac{x}{y})},\arccos{(y)})
    \label{eq:equation11}
\end{equation}

Thus, when mapping to a sphere UV coordinates are projected into 3D space and when mapping to a skybox the opposite happens: normalized 3d space positions continuously seek equivalent UV coordinates.



\subsection{ Mapping Equirectangular Images to a Cubemap} \label{subsec:equiconvtocubemap}

The first step to use a Cubemap is to generate a cube. The standard cube generated by Unity, however, does not have enough vertices for precise UV mapping. It happens as UV mapping is a sine/cosine function whereas rasterization inside of a triangle obtains UV values through linear interpolation of its vertices, thus causing distortions.

For better results, we divided each triangle into four parts. From a cube of 10 vertices and 12 triangles, we obtained a 4090 vertices/triangles cube.

As we generate each new vertex, it is possible to calculate its respective UV coordinate using equation 11. Noticeably, the cubemap view is equivalent to the discretization of the continuous UV mapping approach in a skybox, i.e., it is calculated per vertex instead of being applied on pixel basis.

\subsection{Image Quality Analysis Metrics} \label{metrics}
With regards to the metrics, the goal of the objective image quality assessment is to develop a quantitative measure that can determine the quality of any given image. It is difficult, though, to find a single objective and easy-to-calculate measurement that matches the visual inspection and is suitable for a variety of application requirements. To address this problem, we use three different metrics which are:
Mean Square Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The image which has the smallest MSE, and highest SSIM and PSNR, is assumed to have better quality. MSE can be computed as:

\begin{equation}
MSE=\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{e(m,n)^2}}.
\label{eq:mse}
\end{equation}

Similarly, SSIM assumes that neighboring pixels in an image have strong inter-dependencies, and these dependencies carry important information about the structure of the objects~\cite{wang2004image}. SSIM can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
SSIM(x,y)=\frac{(2*\mu_x*\mu_y+C_1)*(2*\sigma_{xy}+C_2)}{(\mu^2_x+\mu^2_y+C_1)*(\sigma^2_x+\sigma^2_y+C_2)},
\label{eq:ssim}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_X$ and $\mu_y$ are the mean intensity value, $\sigma^2_x$ and $\sigma^2_y$ are the variance of the corresponding images, whereas $\sigma_{xy}$ is the covariance of image $X$ and $Y$. Also, $C_1=(k_1L)^2$ and $C_1=(k_2L)^2$ are stability parameters, where $K_1=0.01$ and $k_2=0.03$. \par
Peak Signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is the most frequently used metric for image quality assessment, and can be computed using MSE as:
\begin{equation}
PSNR = 10*log_{10}{\frac{(2^n-1)^2}{MSE}}.
\label{eq:psnr}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental Results} \label{sec:experiments}
This section presents the implementation details of the proposed method, and qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method.

\subsection{System Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig:fig_architecture} shows the connected components in the architecture of the proposed method. The proposed architecture contain two layers: Unity layer and Python layer. Unity layer implementation involves a C$\#$ configuration layer in unity editor to generate images. Moreover, the python layer is used for calculating the objective metrics for each of the Unity-generated images. To make efficient communication, Cross-tiered communication among layers take place through the creation of new processes within the Unity editor.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Architecture of the proposed quality assessment tool.}
    \label{fig:fig_architecture}
\end{figure}

To make pleasant user experience, an editor interface has been developed in the form of a custom unity inspector, that is, a custom view of our component in C$\#$. In this component user can define multiple preferences for the output image. These preferences include field of view angle, width and height of the image, directions of the generated image, comparison metrics to be used, and define whether graphs or a report will be generated at the end of the process. \par

Furthermore, the python layer is responsible for evaluating the pairs of images generated by unity layer. These images are evaluated using the scikit, numpy, and matplotlib
libraries and the result of each metric is saved in a report at the end, which summarize all the results.

The proposed tool was developed using Unity 2017.3.1F and python 2.7. This custom editor tool can be imported into any Unity project through a unitypackage, a standard format from Unity to distribute resources and tools. When adding VR360QualityTool script to a GameObject, the interface depicted at figure ~\ref{fig:tool} is presented. The field 'Screenshot Directions' allows to define one or more target directions, as explained in section ~\ref{sec:proposedMethod}. For \textcolor{blue}{our experiments, we used directions $D_0 = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)$, $D_1 = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)$ and $D_2 = (1.0, 0.0, -1.0)$, respectively right, upside and foward. Each direction can be visualized in figures~\ref{fig_examples1},~\ref{fig_examples3} and~\ref{fig_examples6}. Different rendering approach were used in our experiments: Skybox, a sphere-based shader $S$, a cubemap shader $C_e$ with an interpolation error, and a normal cubemap shader $C_f$. Both cubemap implementations are employing equirectangular conversion as explained at subsection \ref{subsec:equiconvtocubemap} }


\textcolor{blue}{To perform the quality assessment each image is compared to its respective direction in the reference image. In figure~\ref{fig:skybox0} the screenshot image of the skybox is shown which is used as the gold standard. The skybox rendered image is compared with those obtained with the spherical rendering $S$ in figure~\ref{fig:Sphere0}, with cubemap rendering $C_e$ in figure~\ref{fig:Cubemap0} and with cubemap rendering $C_f$ in figure~\ref{fig:Cubemap1}. Figures~\ref{fig_examples1},~\ref{fig_examples3} and ~\ref{fig_examples6} shows some example images of the results produced using the proposed approach. It can be inferred from the presented figures that mapping equirectangular images to sphere are more similar to our gold standard, because Skybox rendering is a continuous sphere-based implementation. This similarity creates a pleasant scene to the user, because it's more close to widespread rendering of 360 images. Also, the structure in the result image obtained by using spherical mapping is smoother than cubemap.} \par


Based on the obtained results, we found that the sphere images perform better than the cubemap images, possibly due to an interpolation error in fragment shader and it is visible in figures ~\ref{fig:Cubemap0} and ~\ref{fig:Cubemap1}.

The results are summarized in the generated report, as demonstrated by the table~\ref{table_metrics}. The SSIM metric analyzes structural distortions as well as luminance and contrast differences between a reference image and the processed image. According to this metric, the sphere had the best results in all given directions.

\textcolor{blue}{For sphere rendering approach, directions 1 and 2 had the best results according to PSNR and MSE.} Direction 0 did not present good results and that is due to the mapping degradation which can be easily perceived subjectively. After quick subjective analysis, it would be understandable to conclude that sphere - direction 2 has better image quality when compared to the cubemap, but after a deeper investigation it is observable that the sphere mapped images have distortions all over its image while the cubemap has distortions in specific areas affected by the mapping degradation. \textcolor{red}{What is the output then??? COMPLETE THIS PLEASE. WHAT IMAGE IS SELECTED IN THESE CASES? ALSO EXPLAIN DIRECTION AT SOME POINT. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MISSING LINK.}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We proposed the development of an equirectangular image quality assessment tool which uses objective metrics such as MSE, SSIM and PSNR in order to facilitate choosing among different image resolutions and mapping solutions.

Our tool is integrated into the Unity Editor as Unity is the most used development engine for virtual reality applications. Different parameters were used to compare the quality of 360\degree images generated by three UV mapping techniques: latitude/longitude in a inverted sphere; skybox; and cubemap.

One of the disadvantages of our tool is that the user needs to know the metrics to be able to make the best parameters choice. For future work, we plan to use the current metrics to achieve a single and final evaluation value that should indicate the best result in an automated manner. Another improvement point identified is that the accuracy of the end result should be greater if the visualization is obtained directly from rendering on the mobile devices where VR applications can be executed. Thus, we also plan an embedded component in the application that allows you to reap results while running the application on the mobile device.
